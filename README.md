# Helios-installer
Installer Jar for HeliosClient utility mod

# How to run
- Make sure you have java 21 or above installed (which you probably do given you are using minecraft).
- Then download the latest installer from the [releases](https://github.com/HeliosMinecraft/Helios-installer/releases) tab
- Run the jar file by simply double-clicking.

# Visual Elements
On running the installer, you will see a GUI with the following buttons:
- Version tag chooser
- Destination folder chooser
- Install button

as well as a progress bar displaying the download progress

> The `version tag` drop down option represents tags in the [client's repository](https://github.com/HeliosMinecraft/HeliosClient/tags).
> 
> The options will look like this:
> `<tag> / <tag name>`
>
> Most of the time, we will mention the current version of minecraft the mod supports with the tag name, like `1.0.0 / v1.0.0 1.20.4` or similar.
> 
### _Note: The latest tag is the generated pre-release and is frequently updated / changed. The build may be buggy and only should be used when you know what you are doing._

> Next is the `destination folder chooser`. The folder chosen in this prompt will determine the installation directory of heliosclient.
>
>  By default, it is the
> `AppData/Roaming/.minecraft/mods`.


> Finally, is the `install` button which will simply begin the downloading process. You will be notified when the installation is successful. You can also see the progress bar.
