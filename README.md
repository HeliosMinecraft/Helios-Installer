# Helios Installer

**Installer Jar for HeliosClient Utility Mod**

## How to Run

1. **Ensure Java 21 or Above**: Make sure you have Java 21 or above installed. This is likely already installed if you're using Minecraft.
2. **Download the Installer**: Get the latest installer from the [releases](https://github.com/HeliosMinecraft/Helios-installer/releases) tab.
3. **Run the Jar File**: Simply double-click the downloaded jar file to run it.

## Visual Elements

When you run the installer, you will see a GUI with the following elements:

- **Version Tag Chooser**: Select the version tag from a dropdown menu.
- **Destination Folder Chooser**: Choose the folder where HeliosClient will be installed.
- **Install Button**: Start the installation process.
- **Progress Bar**: Displays the download progress.

### Version Tag Chooser

The `version tag` dropdown option represents tags in the [client's repository](https://github.com/HeliosMinecraft/HeliosClient/tags). The options will look like this:

```
<tag> / <tag name>
```

Most of the time, the tag name will include the current version of Minecraft that the mod supports, such as `1.0.0 / v1.0.0 1.20.4` or similar.

> **Note**: The latest tag is a generated pre-release and is frequently updated or changed. This build may be buggy and should only be used if you know what you are doing.

### Destination Folder Chooser

The folder chosen in this prompt will determine the installation directory of HeliosClient. By default, it is set to:

```
AppData/Roaming/.minecraft/mods
```

### Install Button

Clicking the `install` button will begin the downloading process. You will be notified when the installation is successful, and you can monitor the progress via the progress bar.
